users can operate Long or Short With Leverage 
Also users can MINT a Representation of the Leverage Position and Use it as collateral 
So User can provide Liquidity To Uniswap, Use NFT as collateral, open a Long Position X2 and 
use this position as collateral to open a new x2 position in another token.


Users can Use USDC as collateral, and leverage it to add Liquidity
to a Uniswap V3 Position. So an User can use 100 USDC to add a position of 1000 USDC to uniswap V3.
